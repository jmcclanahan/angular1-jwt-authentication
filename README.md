# solar-frontend

This is the user-facing piece of my version of the SOLAR application. It
is built with [Angularjs](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
and leverages [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular)
to communicate with the solar-backend project via JSON.

The build tools are as follows:
* Gulp - Task runner used for javascript/css minification, local server, livereload, etc
* Bower - Used for dependency management (Will be phased out for npm)
* Npm - Used for dependency management
